Flownode-php
============

UI Components, request and response management for asynchronous client request.


## Why Flownode ?

###1. Flownode.UI

Flownode for php 5.3+ aims to build UI components on server-side, which is not a "natural" way for php-developpers. 

Yes, a lot a php-framework manage forms components, like Symfony. Prado framework introduces a component approach in a quite similar way of Aspx or JavaServerFaces. But assuming that php-coded applications works behind a web server and DotNet / J2EE web applications works inside an application server, we can just mimic them in php.

Flownode.UI has 4 goals :

* Providing foundations to easily create and manipulate DOM elements
* Giving the base architecture to make components easily reusables : that's really the heart of this projets
* Easily extends those components to make them working with client-side library like Twitter Bootrap or jQuery UI for exemple
* To be used along with the Flownode-js library

Flownode should remains a standalone library, not a whole UI components framework. So it could be easily integrated with existing server-side frameworks or template engines.
